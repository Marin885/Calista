# Calista

**Inspiration:** The inspiration behind 'Calista' came from the common struggles faced by programmers when navigating extensive technical documentation. We aimed to simplify this process and make learning from documentation more efficient.

**What it does:** 'Calista' is a revolutionary virtual assistant designed to simplify the lives of programmers. It allows users to upload their own documentation in the form of text documents or search for existing documentation on technologies with official documentation. It simplifies documentation search through an intuitive search bar and recommends related technologies based on user input. Additionally, 'Calista' can access documentation from both the latest and older versions of technologies.

**How we built it:** We built 'Calista' using a combination of programming languages and technologies, like Python for the back-end, and various natural language processing libraries for understanding user queries. We also utilized cloud services for data storage and retrieval.

**Challenges we ran into:** Adjusting the filters and focus of our virtual assistant

**Accomplishments that we're proud of:** We are proud of creating an innovative solution that significantly simplifies the process of learning from technical documentation. 'Calista' not only streamlines access to documentation but also provides a workspace for programmers to enhance their productivity.

**What we learned:** During the development of 'Calista,' we learned about the complexities of natural language processing, recommendation systems, and cloud-based data management. We also gained insights into the importance of user-friendly interfaces for technical tools.

**What's next for Calista:** In the future, we plan to enhance 'Calista' by integrating more advanced AI capabilities for even better documentation understanding and assistance. We also aim to expand its compatibility with a wider range of programming languages and frameworks.

**Built With:**

- Python (Backend)
